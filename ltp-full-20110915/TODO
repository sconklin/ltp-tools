The following things need to be rewritten // fixed

get_mempolicy01 // mbind01: They're using numa v1 calls which means that all
versions of Linux / numa as of a few years ago aren't compatible with the API
calls and thus you aren't truly testing the calls via libnuma properly.

This was implemented via ad hoc static v1 code previously, but this isn't what
we want as all consumers outside of LTP will be using either v1 or v2 code,
depending on what libraries, APIs, etc are packaged with their copy of
libnuma // kernel.

quotactl01:

This should generate dummy tmpfs partitions and delete them after the testcase is
done as this test isn't executable on most systems (unless we're lucky and
someone setup quotas on it already). A good amount of legwork was done with
lib/mount_utils.c, but I've backed that out because it needed more polishing to
get to a functional state, and the device *should* be generated outside of the
quotactl01 test and destroyed at the end.

The following items need fixing with the new Makefile infrastructure:

testcases/kernel/controllers/freezer/libcgroup_freezer:
1. Uses pushd / popd, which isn't present in busybox.

testcases/kernel/fs/dmapi/Makefile:
1. This test requires JFS support, which most systems don't have. So a set of
   proper autoconf tests need to be added for this as well.

testcases/kernel/hotplug/cpu_hotplug/tools/report_proc_interrupts:
-  Is written in perl; should be rewritten in POSIX compliant bourne shell.

testcases/kernel/hotplug/cpu_hotplug/...:
1. Add in logic to install at runtime; you have to run it from the source tree
   today, s.t. the runtest file is broken.

testcases/kernel/sched/nptl/Makefile:
1. There's a $(shell ) call in the Makefile that needs to be replaced.

testcases/network/multicast/...:
1. These tests need to be fixed because they use make / install logic in the
   tests:

<<<test_end>>>

testcases/network/rpc/rpc-tirpc-full-test-suite:
1. This needs to be integrated into the build with a Makefile, as it's not
   getting copied over with the install.

testcases/network/tcp_cmds/perf_lan/Makefile:
1. There are duplicate sourcefiles because I don't feel confident as far as
   the changes were concerned on the sourcefiles and I was running into
   compile issues with the IPv6 code.

testcases/network/stress/udp/...:
1. Many of the scripts are installing themselves using the old-status quo
   method of hardlinking into $(abs_top_srcdir)/testcases/bin, which means
   that all of the scripts are being linked to the file
   $(abs_top_srcdir)/testcases/bin .

testcases/realtime/run.sh:
1. Uses pushd / popd, which isn't present in busybox.

tools/Makefile:
1. netpipe* needs fixing and reorg, because it's referencing /home/mpich, etc.

tools/create_kernel_faults_in_loops_and_probability.pl:
tools/create_valgrind_check.pl:
1. Could and should be rewritten in a unified awk wrapper.
