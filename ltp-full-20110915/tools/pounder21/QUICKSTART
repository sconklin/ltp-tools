Quick and Dirty Guide to Setting Up Pounder
Copyright (C) 2003-2006 IBM.

0. Install system.  gcc and related development packages are required by
   pounder; for extra stress testing, enable X too.
1. Download and unpack the LTP tarball.  You've already done this.
2. cd testcases/pounder21/.  You've already done this too.
3. Set up a NFS server to export "/pounder".
4. Add the following to "config":

export DO_X_TESTS=1
export NFS_SERVER=<your NFS server here>
export NTP_SERVER=pool.ntp.org

5. ./Install
6. ./pounder

This should take approximately two days to run to completion.  If your machine
hangs, you can use the magic SysRq key (if you built it into the kernel) to
obtain debugging information, kdumps, etc.
